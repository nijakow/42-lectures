# An Introduction to Patterns

> How do you know what to write in C? I have a rough understanding of what my program should do, how can I teach it to the computer?

This is a question that I have been asked a lot in the last few weeks. For a while I didn't have a proper answer to it, but now I think that I do.

## Thinking in Patterns
	
The key behind being able to tell the computer what to do is to not think of a C program as a bunch of instructions that are being executed line-by-line in a top-to-bottom manner, but rather as a collection of so-called _Patterns_. A pattern is a single, standalone piece of C code - often consisting of only a few (though sometimes more) lines - that serves exactly one purpose. When you're writing a program, your task is to select the correct patterns for your program, put them in the right order and connect them in a meaningful fashion.

Think of it as a "fill in the blank"-text ("LÃ¼ckentext" in German), where you have a basic template that serves a particular purpose. Filling in the blanks with other patterns gives you the ability to customize its behavior.
